# ST558 Final Project
## Kara Belknap, 12/12/22

## Purpose

The purpose of this R Shiny app is to investigate how different offensive and defensive factors affect the percentage of games an MLB team will win in a regular MLB season. The app contains four main pages: 1. An about page in which the data is explained in detail, 2. An exploratory data analysis page in which a user can look at a number of different factors and how those factors affect the success of a team, 3. A modeling page that allows a user to investigate different regression models that relate to the data, and 4. A data page in which the user can subset the data and download the raw data to a .csv file for their own exploration.

## Packages Used

The following packages were used in the development of this package:
tidyverse, knitr, shiny, shinydashboard, DT, mathjaxr, caret, and randomForest.
